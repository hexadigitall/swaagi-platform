# 🚀 SWAAGI Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** → https://github.com/new

3. **Description:** `SWAAGI - Your AI-powered style companion. Find your swag, anywhere in the world. Personalized styling recommendations celebrating global diversity.`
4. **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
5. **DON'T initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

Copy your repository URL and run these commands:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/swaagi-platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. **Import** your `swaagi-platform` repository
5. **Framework Preset:** Next.js (should auto-detect)
6. **Root Directory:** `05-development/frontend`
7. **Build Command:** `npm run build` (should auto-fill)
8. **Output Directory:** `.next` (should auto-fill)
9. Click **"Deploy"**

### Option B: Vercel CLI
```bash
cd 05-development/frontend
npx vercel --prod
```

## Step 4: Configure Vercel Project

2. **Root Directory:** Set to `05-development/frontend`
3. **Build & Output Settings:**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

## Step 5: Test Your Deployed App

Your app will be available at a URL like:
- `https://swaagi-platform.vercel.app`
- Or a custom domain if you set one up (e.g., `swaagi.com`, `swaagi.app`)

## 🎯 Expected Results

Once deployed, you'll have:
- ✅ **13 fully functional pages**
- ✅ **Responsive design** (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ **Dark/light mode toggle**
- ✅ **Interactive AI stylist**
- ✅ **Professional animations**
- ✅ **Complete user workflows**

## 📱 Test on Different Devices

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
If you see build errors:
```bash
cd 05-development/frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### Root Directory Issues
Make sure Vercel is set to build from: `05-development/frontend`

### Hydration Warnings
The app works perfectly despite some hydration warnings (time display issue). This doesn't affect functionality.
