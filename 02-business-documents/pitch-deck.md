## Slide 2: The Problem
### Online Fashion Shopping Hasn't Evolved

**The Current Reality:**
- 73% of online shoppers feel overwhelmed by too many choices
- People visit 5-7 different sites just to complete one outfit
- Generic recommendations don't account for personal style or cultural preferences
- Returns cost the industry $100B annually due to poor matching

**Why This Matters:**
Fashion is personal, but current technology treats everyone the same. There's a massive gap between what AI can do and what fashion shoppers actually experience.

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution
### SWAAGI: Personalized Fashion Discovery

**How It Works:**
Users describe what they're looking for in natural language. Our AI understands the context and recommends complete outfits from multiple brands.

**Example Queries:**
- "I need something professional but not boring for client meetings"
- "Show me casual weekend outfits that work for brunch"
- "What should I wear to a summer wedding?"

**What Makes Us Different:**
- **Contextual Understanding**: We get the "why" behind what you're looking for
- **Multi-Brand Aggregation**: Shop across 50+ retailers in one place
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Our AI recognizes different style preferences globally
- **Learning System**: Recommendations improve as we learn your taste

We're building the personal stylist everyone wishes they had, accessible to anyone with a smartphone.
